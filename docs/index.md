## Why Lumen?

Lumen is a statically typed language for shipping production-grade agent workflows without stitching together prompts, glue code, and orchestration layers by hand.

It gives you:

- One language for business logic, orchestration, and tool calling.
- First-class support for `.lm` and `.lm.md` source files.
- An implementation-backed runtime model with deterministic execution controls.
